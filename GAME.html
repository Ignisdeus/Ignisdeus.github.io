First, I <b>"Visualise"</b> the mechanic and how it works within the game world outlining the possible interaction that the player may have with the mechanic. This involves creating diagrams and excel sheets to evaluate the impact it will have on the game.<br /> <br />

Second <b>"Prototype"</b> This is the most important part involving two main focuses build the mechanic in a white box world. Focusing on implementing it as well as possible but the intention of making it work if that means making the code ugly for now do it, we need to "Test". Followed by testing this by your self, to random people. If you can watch them testing the mechanic see what they enjoy and make it more prominent while removing or limiting the elements that they don't appear to like.  <br /> <br /> 

Third <b>"Feedback"</b> adding in as much feedback to the player as possible Audio, Visual, Tactile tell the player in as many ways as possible that they are doing something correctly. This section also including cleaning up any code or parts that could slow down the game in any way.
